# WASM Launch Rollout, Support Model, and Post-GA Stabilization

**Bead**: `asupersync-umelq.17.5`  
**Contract ID**: `wasm-launch-rollout-support-stabilization-v1`  
**Program**: `asupersync-umelq.17` (WASM-16 Pilot Program, GA Readiness, and Launch Governance)

## Purpose

Define a deterministic launch rollout protocol and support operating model that
minimizes user impact during regressions, enforces explicit incident handling
cadence, and gates post-GA stabilization exit on replay-backed evidence.

## Prerequisites and Inputs

Required upstream contracts:

| Bead | Required Input |
|---|---|
| `asupersync-umelq.17.4` | `docs/wasm_ga_readiness_review_board_checklist.md`, `artifacts/wasm_ga_readiness_decision_packet.json` |
| `asupersync-umelq.15.5` | `docs/wasm_release_rollback_incident_playbook.md`, `artifacts/wasm_release_rollback_playbook_summary.json` |
| `asupersync-umelq.17.3` | `docs/wasm_pilot_feedback_triage_loop.md`, triage disposition outputs |
| `asupersync-umelq.16.5` | `docs/wasm_rationale_index.md`, rationale-linked operator guidance |

Launch cannot advance if any upstream contract is missing or stale.

## Browser Edition Release Bundle Mapping

This operating model is also the launch envelope for `asupersync-3qv04.7.3`,
where Browser Edition pilot and GA criteria must be backed by real artifacts
instead of policy-only declarations.
In practice, rollout cannot advance unless Gate 6 package-release and
consumer-build artifacts from `docs/wasm_release_channel_strategy.md` are
present for the candidate under review.
That package-release evidence must include command provenance for the full
Browser Edition package gate: `corepack pnpm run validate` or both
`bash scripts/validate_package_build.sh` and
`bash scripts/validate_npm_pack_smoke.sh`.

Minimum Browser Edition evidence bundle before `L0_INTERNAL`:

1. `asupersync-3qv04.6.5` packaged ABI evidence:
   `docs/wasm_abi_compatibility_policy.md`,
   `artifacts/wasm_abi_contract_summary.json`, and
   `artifacts/wasm_abi_contract_events.ndjson`.
2. `asupersync-3qv04.6.6` packaged browser-behavior harnesses:
   `docs/wasm_packaged_bootstrap_harness_contract.md`,
   `docs/wasm_packaged_cancellation_harness_contract.md`,
   `artifacts/wasm_packaged_bootstrap_harness_v1.json`, and
   `artifacts/wasm_packaged_cancellation_harness_v1.json`.
3. `asupersync-3qv04.6.7` aggregate performance-budget outputs:
   `.github/wasm_perf_budgets.json`,
   `artifacts/wasm_budget_summary.json`, and
   `artifacts/wasm_perf_regression_report.json`.
4. `asupersync-3qv04.6.7.1`, `asupersync-3qv04.6.7.2`, and
   `asupersync-3qv04.6.7.3` size, startup, and cancellation-budget leaves:
   `docs/wasm_bundle_size_budget.md`,
   `artifacts/wasm_bundle_size_budget_v1.json`,
   `artifacts/wasm_packaged_bootstrap_perf_summary.json`, and
   `artifacts/wasm_packaged_cancellation_perf_summary.json`.
5. `asupersync-3qv04.6.8` package-manager and module-resolution evidence:
   `docs/wasm_bundler_compatibility_matrix.md`,
   `docs/wasm_typescript_package_topology.md`,
   `artifacts/wasm_typescript_package_summary.json`, and
   `artifacts/wasm_typescript_package_log.ndjson`.
6. `asupersync-3qv04.7.1` release outputs:
   `artifacts/npm/package_release_validation.json`,
   `artifacts/npm/package_pack_dry_run_summary.json`, and
   `artifacts/npm/publish_outcome.json`.
7. `asupersync-3qv04.7.2` supply-chain artifacts:
   `docs/wasm_browser_sbom_v1.json`,
   `docs/wasm_browser_provenance_attestation_v1.json`, and
   `docs/wasm_browser_artifact_integrity_manifest_v1.json`.
8. `asupersync-3qv04.8.6` onboarding and QA smoke artifacts:
   `wasm-browser-onboarding-smoke`, `wasm-qa-smoke-bundles`,
   `wasm-qa-smoke-suite-summaries`,
   `artifacts/onboarding/vanilla.summary.json`,
   `artifacts/onboarding/react.summary.json`,
   `artifacts/onboarding/next.summary.json`,
   `artifacts/onboarding/worker.summary.json`,
   `target/e2e-results/dedicated_worker_consumer/<timestamp>/summary.json`,
   `target/e2e-results/dedicated_worker_consumer/<timestamp>/browser-run.json`,
   and `target/e2e-results/wasm_qa_evidence_smoke/run_<timestamp>/summary.json`.
9. `asupersync-3qv04.9.1`, `asupersync-3qv04.9.2`, `asupersync-3qv04.9.3`,
   `asupersync-3qv04.9.4`, and `asupersync-3qv04.9.5` developer-facing surfaces:
   `docs/wasm_quickstart_migration.md`,
   `docs/wasm_bundler_compatibility_matrix.md`,
   `docs/wasm_canonical_examples.md`,
   `docs/wasm_troubleshooting_compendium.md`, and
   `docs/wasm_api_surface_census.md`,
   `target/e2e-results/rust_browser_consumer/<timestamp>/summary.json`, and
   `target/e2e-results/rust_browser_consumer/<timestamp>/browser-run.json`.
10. Board and launch certification artifacts:
   `wasm-ga-readiness-review-board-certification` and
   `wasm-launch-rollout-support-stabilization-certification`.

If this Browser Edition evidence bundle is incomplete, rollout must remain
blocked regardless of higher-level board approval text.

## Rollout Stages and Guardrails

| Stage | Target Audience | Entry Criteria | Exit Criteria | Communication Obligation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `L0_INTERNAL` | Internal maintainers | GA board decision packet exists | 7-day incident-free internal soak | Daily internal status digest |
| `L1_PILOT` | Existing pilot cohort | `L0_INTERNAL` complete + telemetry healthy | 14-day pilot SLO pass | Weekly pilot summary + issue digest |
| `L2_CANARY` | Opt-in external adopters | pilot triage queue below threshold | 21-day canary stability and no severe unresolved incident | Public weekly release notes + rollback notice channel |
| `L3_GA` | All users | canary success + support readiness quorum | declared GA and active post-GA watch | GA launch brief + support SLA publication |
| `L4_STABILIZATION` | GA users under enhanced watch | GA live with instrumentation coverage | stabilization exit criteria satisfied | Bi-weekly stabilization report |

## Surface-Specific Rollout Floors and Ceilings

The launch stages above govern the Browser Edition baseline. The vNext browser
surfaces must still respect their own rollout floors and ceilings.

| Surface | Earliest rollout stage | Highest stage without extra closure | Required artifact bundle before `L3_GA` claim | Default downgrade path |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `Dedicated Web Worker` direct-runtime lane | `L1_PILOT` | may reach `L3_GA` only after worker onboarding + contract evidence is green in the candidate window | `artifacts/onboarding/worker.summary.json`, `target/e2e-results/dedicated_worker_consumer/<timestamp>/summary.json`, `target/e2e-results/dedicated_worker_consumer/<timestamp>/browser-run.json`, `tests/wasm_browser_feasibility_matrix.rs`, `tests/wasm_js_exports_coverage_contract.rs`, `PATH=/usr/bin:$PATH bash scripts/validate_dedicated_worker_consumer.sh`; the reviewed candidate must preserve the dedicated-worker `scenario_inventory` plus artifact pointers under `artifacts` in the summary bundle | downgrade the worker lane to `L2_CANARY`; keep the browser main-thread runtime as the supported GA fallback |
| `IndexedDB` durable storage + `BrowserArtifactStore` | `L1_PILOT` | may reach `L3_GA` only after storage/export diagnostics and maintained fixture evidence are green | `target/e2e-results/vite_vanilla_consumer/<timestamp>/summary.json`, `target/e2e-results/dedicated_worker_consumer/<timestamp>/summary.json`, `tests/wasm_browser_feasibility_matrix.rs`, `tests/wasm_js_exports_coverage_contract.rs` | downgrade durable storage/artifact promises to `L2_CANARY` and keep users on explicit export / cleanup guidance |
| Rust-authored browser path | `L1_PILOT` | `L1_PILOT` / `preview_only`; no `L3_GA` claim while the dispatcher-backed builder remains narrower than the shipped JS/TS Browser Edition packages | `PATH=/usr/bin:$PATH bash scripts/validate_rust_browser_consumer.sh`, `target/e2e-results/rust_browser_consumer/<timestamp>/summary.json`, `target/e2e-results/rust_browser_consumer/<timestamp>/browser-run.json`, `tests/wasm_rust_browser_example_contract.rs`, `docs/wasm_quickstart_migration.md` | revert to the repository fixture workflow and remove any preview-public or stable wording |
| `WebTransport` datagrams | `L1_PILOT` | `L2_CANARY` and `guarded canary-only` unless fallback evidence remains green | `tests/wasm_browser_feasibility_matrix.rs`, `tests/wasm_js_exports_coverage_contract.rs`, `docs/WASM.md`, `docs/wasm_troubleshooting_compendium.md` | downgrade to `preview_only` and require `WebSocket` / `fetch` fallback messaging |
| Service-worker bounded broker registration + durable handoff | `L1_PILOT` | `L2_CANARY` / `guarded canary-only`; never `L3_GA` while the host remains a fail-closed direct-runtime denial | `docs/wasm_service_worker_broker_contract.md`, `tests/wasm_service_worker_broker_contract.rs`, `tests/fixtures/service-worker-broker-consumer/`, `PATH=/usr/bin:$PATH bash scripts/validate_service_worker_broker_consumer.sh`, `target/e2e-results/service_worker_broker_consumer/<timestamp>/summary.json`, `target/e2e-results/service_worker_broker_consumer/<timestamp>/browser-run.json`, `docs/WASM.md`, `packages/browser/src/index.ts`; the reviewed candidate must preserve the maintained broker validator, summary/browser-run artifact bundle, explicit broker registration, durable handoff, and downgrade diagnostics without widening the host claim | downgrade to `preview_only`, keep `service_worker_not_yet_shipped` / `service_worker_direct_runtime_not_shipped` as the public truth, and route users to dedicated-worker or browser main-thread fallback guidance |
| Shared-worker bounded coordinator attach + downgrade | `L1_PILOT` | `L2_CANARY` / `guarded canary-only`; never `L3_GA` while SharedWorker direct runtime remains fail-closed | `docs/wasm_shared_worker_tenancy_lifecycle_contract.md`, `tests/wasm_browser_feasibility_matrix.rs`, `tests/wasm_js_exports_coverage_contract.rs`, `tests/fixtures/shared-worker-consumer/`, `PATH=/usr/bin:$PATH bash scripts/validate_shared_worker_consumer.sh`, `target/e2e-results/shared_worker_consumer/<timestamp>/summary.json`, `target/e2e-results/shared_worker_consumer/<timestamp>/browser-run.json`, `docs/WASM.md`, `packages/browser/src/index.ts`; the reviewed candidate must preserve the maintained coordinator validator, summary/browser-run artifact bundle, explicit coordinator attach, version handshake, and downgrade semantics | downgrade to `preview_only`, keep `shared_worker_direct_runtime_not_shipped` as the public truth, and route users back to dedicated-worker or browser main-thread fallback guidance |
| Browser-native messaging (`MessageChannel`, `MessagePort`, `BroadcastChannel`) | `L0_INTERNAL` | `preview_only` until public Browser Edition APIs ship | `docs/wasm_api_surface_census.md`, `docs/WASM.md`, public API contract tests once exported | revert to application-boundary-only guidance |
| `SharedArrayBuffer` / worker offload / parallel executor lanes | `L0_INTERNAL` | `nightly-only`; never default `L3_GA` while `asupersync-2jhnk.*` remains open | `asupersync-2jhnk.2`, `asupersync-2jhnk.3`, `asupersync-2jhnk.4`, `asupersync-2jhnk.5`, plus replay/chaos/perf evidence | disable the lane and demote `canary -> nightly` or preview-only |

## Rollback Triggers

Automatic rollback triggers:

1. `LR-01`: SEV-1 incident at any stage.
2. `LR-02`: repeated SEV-2 incidents over 24h threshold.
3. `LR-03`: SLO breach against pilot/canary reliability budgets.
4. `LR-04`: security release gate blocker.
5. `LR-05`: replay artifact missing for severe incident.
6. `LR-06`: a vNext surface is published above its allowed rollout ceiling.
7. `LR-07`: the required surface-specific artifact bundle goes stale or missing.

Rollback action must follow `docs/wasm_release_rollback_incident_playbook.md`
with deterministic command capture and artifact revocation logging.

## Support Model and Escalation Routing

Required roles:

1. Launch Commander
2. Support Lead
3. Incident Commander
4. Runtime On-Call Engineer
5. Security On-Call
6. Communications Lead

Escalation policy:

- Tier-1 support triages incoming incidents in <= 30 minutes.
- Tier-2 engineering response in <= 60 minutes for SEV-2+.
- Incident Commander must be assigned for SEV-1/SEV-2.
- Security On-Call is mandatory for any release-blocking security signal.

## Communication Cadence

Per-stage communication requirements:

1. stage transition announcement with gate evidence links,
2. incident updates at fixed cadence (`30m` for SEV-1, `60m` for SEV-2),
3. rollback announcement with mitigation instructions,
4. resolution summary containing replay command and postmortem owner.

Canonical channels:

- `release-notes` stream for planned transitions,
- `incident-updates` stream for active mitigation,
- user-facing status page for outages/degradations,
- roadmap updates linked to triage disposition from `17.3`.

## Launch Rehearsal and E2E Coordination

Deterministic rehearsal command bundle:

```bash
rch exec -- cargo test -p asupersync --test wasm_launch_rollout_support_stabilization -- --nocapture
rch exec -- cargo test -p asupersync --test wasm_ga_readiness_review_board_checklist -- --nocapture
rch exec -- cargo test -p asupersync --test wasm_release_rollback_incident_playbook -- --nocapture
rch exec -- cargo test -p asupersync --test wasm_pilot_feedback_triage_loop -- --nocapture
```

The rehearsal is non-compliant unless support escalation, incident comms, and
rollback pathways are all exercised and artifactized.

## Structured Logging and Artifacts

Required launch/stabilization artifacts:

- `artifacts/wasm_launch_rollout_support_stabilization_summary.json`
- `artifacts/wasm_launch_rollout_support_stabilization_test.log`
- `artifacts/wasm_ga_readiness_decision_packet.json`
- `artifacts/wasm_release_rollback_playbook_summary.json`
- `artifacts/pilot/pilot_observability_summary.json`

Mandatory log fields:

- `launch_stage`
- `incident_id`
- `severity`
- `user_impact_scope`
- `escalation_route`
- `mitigation_action`
- `repro_command`
- `trace_pointer`
- `stabilization_gate`

## Stabilization Exit Criteria

Post-GA stabilization may close only when all conditions hold:

1. 30 consecutive days without unresolved SEV-1 incident.
2. All SEV-2 incidents have replay-backed postmortem closure.
3. Rollback drills executed and passed at defined cadence.
4. Support SLA adherence >= 99% during stabilization window.
5. High-priority launch regressions from `17.3` disposition are closed or
   explicitly deferred with board-approved rationale.

If any condition regresses, stage remains `L4_STABILIZATION`.

## Optimization Roadmap Assimilation

Follow-up optimization intake must bind to:

- pilot feedback triage outputs (`17.3`),
- rationale index decisions (`16.5`),
- incident forensics evidence (`15.5` and replay logs).

Every optimization candidate needs:

1. user-impact statement,
2. risk classification,
3. deterministic repro benchmark or trace command,
4. owning bead ID and target release stage.

## CI Certification Contract

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` must enforce a dedicated certification step that:

1. runs `wasm_launch_rollout_support_stabilization` test target,
2. emits `artifacts/wasm_launch_rollout_support_stabilization_summary.json`,
3. uploads audit artifacts under a unique launch-support certification bundle.
