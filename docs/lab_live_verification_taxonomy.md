# Lab-vs-Live Verification Taxonomy and Logging Standard

**Bead**: `asupersync-2a6k9.1.4`  
**Parent**: `asupersync-2a6k9.1`, `asupersync-2a6k9`  
**Author**: WhiteCrane (codex-cli / gpt-5)  
**Date**: 2026-03-18  
**Standard Version**: `lab-live-verification-taxonomy-v1`

## Purpose

This document defines the minimum verification and logging contract for the
lab-vs-live differential program.

The scope matrix already says which semantic surfaces are admitted. The
normalized observable schema already says what semantic equality means. The
divergence taxonomy already says how failures are classified.

What was still too implicit was the question every implementation bead needs to
answer before it can claim to be "tested":

1. what unit or contract tests are mandatory,
2. what end-to-end differential runs are mandatory,
3. what negative-control or self-calibration evidence is mandatory,
4. what structured logs and artifacts are mandatory when those runs execute.

This document makes those requirements explicit so later beads do not invent
their own private definition of sufficient coverage.

## Upstream Contracts

This standard is downstream of:

- `docs/lab_live_differential_scope_matrix.md`
- `docs/lab_live_normalized_observable_schema.md`
- `docs/lab_live_divergence_taxonomy.md`
- `docs/lab_live_scenario_adapter_contract.md`
- `docs/tokio_differential_behavior_suites.md`
- `TESTING.md`
- `tests/common/mod.rs`

It must be read with one hard rule in mind:

- the scope matrix decides whether a surface may be differentialized,
- the scenario adapter decides how a shared scenario binds to lab and live,
- the normalized schema decides what semantic record both sides must emit,
- this document decides what verification depth and what logging bundle a bead
  must deliver before the program treats that surface as credibly covered.

## Core Rule

No later `asupersync-2a6k9.*` bead is complete with only prose, only unit
tests, or only one successful differential run.

Every executable bead in this program must provide evidence in the following
layers unless this document explicitly marks a layer as not yet required for
that bead class:

1. **unit or contract verification** for the local rule set,
2. **golden or schema verification** for any normalized record or report shape,
3. **dual-run smoke coverage** through the real shared lab/live contract when
   the bead changes executable differential behavior,
4. **negative-control or self-calibration evidence** when the bead changes
   classifier, comparator, logging, or artifact policy,
5. **structured logs and retained artifacts** for every failure or suspicious
   run class the bead can produce.

If a bead cannot satisfy one of these layers, it must say why in its contract
or notes. Silence is not acceptable.

## Verification Taxonomy

The differential program uses the following taxonomy. Later beads should reuse
these labels rather than inventing new categories.

| Tier | Canonical label | Purpose | Typical proof artifact |
|---|---|---|---|
| `T0` | `unit_contract` | Lock local semantics, field sets, policy tokens, and validation commands | direct Rust tests against a doc contract or helper behavior |
| `T1` | `golden_fixture` | Freeze normalized records, schema outputs, or report bundles | checked-in JSON/NDJSON fixture or direct schema assertions |
| `T2` | `dual_run_smoke` | Prove the same scenario executes through lab and live adapter lanes | one deterministic lab/live smoke path |
| `T3` | `pilot_surface` | Exercise the admitted semantic surface with multiple scenario families | phase-1 pilot suites for cancellation, combinators, channels, obligations, region close/quiescence |
| `T4` | `negative_control` | Prove the comparator and policy layers fail for the right reasons | intentionally divergent or artifact-incomplete scenarios |
| `T5` | `stress_nightly` | Explore adversarial or noisy corners after the core contract is stable | retained rerun corpus, nightly seeds, drift bundles |

The important distinction is that these are not five optional ideas. They are
the vocabulary the whole program must use when describing verification depth.

## Minimum Requirements by Bead Class

### 1. Policy or Contract Beads

Examples:

- `asupersync-2a6k9.1.1`
- `asupersync-2a6k9.1.2`
- `asupersync-2a6k9.1.3`
- `asupersync-2a6k9.1.4`

Minimum requirements:

- `T0 unit_contract` is mandatory.
- The contract test must pin:
  - bead ID,
  - parent IDs,
  - upstream dependency documents,
  - key field tokens,
  - downstream bead bindings,
  - `rch exec -- ...` validation commands.
- `T1 golden_fixture` is optional unless the bead defines a concrete serialized
  schema example.
- `T2 dual_run_smoke` is not required if the bead only defines policy and does
  not change executable harness behavior.
- The document must still define what future executable beads owe.

### 2. Shared Harness or Helper Beads

Examples:

- `asupersync-2a6k9.2.2`
- `asupersync-2a6k9.2.4`

Minimum requirements:

- `T0 unit_contract` is mandatory for helper behavior and mismatch messages.
- `T1 golden_fixture` is mandatory whenever helper output is serialized or
  schema-shaped.
- `T2 dual_run_smoke` is mandatory if the helper is consumed by lab/live
  execution paths.
- A helper bead is not complete until at least two differential suites or two
  surface-specific scenarios use the shared helper instead of hand-rolling their
  own assertions.

### 3. Live Evidence, Normalizer, and Comparator Beads

Examples:

- `asupersync-2a6k9.4.*`
- `asupersync-2a6k9.5.*`

Minimum requirements:

- `T0 unit_contract` for mapping rules, classifier logic, and invariant
  interpretation.
- `T1 golden_fixture` for normalized record and report bundle shapes.
- `T2 dual_run_smoke` for at least one shared scenario that emits the changed
  record/report path.
- `T4 negative_control` is mandatory.

Required negative-control cases:

- a semantic mismatch that must classify as a hard failure,
- an artifact-missing run that must classify as `artifact_schema_violation`,
- a provenance-only drift case that must not be promoted to semantic mismatch,
- when applicable, a rerun bundle that stabilizes into the expected final policy
  class.

### 4. Pilot Surface Beads

Examples:

- `asupersync-2a6k9.6.1`
- `asupersync-2a6k9.6.2`
- `asupersync-2a6k9.6.3`
- `asupersync-2a6k9.6.4`
- `asupersync-2a6k9.6.5`
- `asupersync-2a6k9.6.6`

Minimum requirements:

- `T0 unit_contract` for surface-local invariants.
- `T2 dual_run_smoke` for the surface's canonical shared scenario.
- `T3 pilot_surface` for multiple scenario families on the admitted surface.
- `T4 negative_control` for at least one semantic failure witness.
- Logs and artifacts must use the exact vocabulary in this document.

### 5. Expansion, Eligibility, and Operations Beads

Examples:

- `asupersync-2a6k9.7.*`
- `asupersync-2a6k9.8.*`

Minimum requirements:

- inherit all earlier applicable tiers,
- explicitly name the new surface or operator policy being promoted,
- declare whether `T5 stress_nightly` becomes mandatory,
- retain contributor-facing repro commands and operator-facing artifact indexes.

Eligibility-gate beads for external surfaces must do more than say "not yet" or
"probably okay." They must publish the exact boundary, evidence, and failure
contract a later promotion bead must satisfy.

## Eligibility-Gate Matrix for External Surfaces

For `asupersync-2a6k9.7.3`-style work, the gate itself may be contract-only
today, but it must still define the executable floor before any meaningful
parity claim is allowed.

| Surface family | Gate-specific `T0` requirements | Promotion floor before `T2/T3` claims count | Mandatory `T4` rejection cases |
|---|---|---|---|
| `raw_socket` | boundary contract, virtualization boundary, connection-lifecycle field map, unsupported red lines | bounded loopback or virtual transport runner with shared normalized records and retained repro artifacts | unsupported-surface rejection, missing-capture rejection, and kernel-timing non-claim proof |
| `http_surface` | request/response field map, peer-model contract, timeout/cancellation boundary, artifact schema | virtualized or loopback HTTP runner with shared normalized request/response records and shutdown coverage | malformed artifact rejection, under-observed peer rejection, and real-network non-claim proof |
| `browser_surface` | host-role contract, lane-selection policy, downgrade semantics, explicit support boundaries | admitted browser runner lanes with shared normalized semantic subset and retained downgrade artifacts | unsupported-host rejection, downgrade-path proof, and ambient-host-timing non-claim proof |

### Required Eligibility-Gate Log Fields

When a bead publishes or evaluates an external-surface gate, the stable record
must include:

- `eligibility_verdict`
- `surface_family`
- `virtualization_boundary`
- `observability_status`
- `capture_manifest_path`
- `normalized_record_path`
- `artifact_bundle`
- `repro_command`
- `unsupported_reason`

Browser-facing gate records must additionally include:

- `host_role`
- `support_class`
- `reason_code`
- `lane_id`

These are not optional operator niceties. They are the minimum machine-readable
fields required to keep "eligible later" and "unsupported today" from
collapsing into vague prose.

## Minimum Coverage Matrix for Phase 1 Surfaces

The first active rollout lane is still the `Phase 1` ladder from
`docs/lab_live_differential_scope_matrix.md`:

`cancellation -> combinators -> channels -> obligations -> region close/quiescence`

Before the program claims Phase 1 closure, the minimum matrix is:

| Surface | Minimum `T0` coverage | Minimum `T2/T3` coverage | Minimum `T4` coverage |
|---|---|---|---|
| `cancellation` | request/ack/finalize semantics, checkpoint acknowledgement, hard mismatch fields | one shared lab/live scenario with explicit cancel request and completed cleanup | at least one case proving missing cleanup/finalization is a hard failure |
| `combinators` | winner/loser semantics, severity aggregation, join/race intent | one shared loser-drain scenario through both adapters | one case where losers do not drain and the mismatch is retained |
| `channels` | reserve/commit semantics, committed vs aborted accounting, receiver-visible meaning | one shared reserve/send differential scenario | one artifact or semantic case showing cancel-correct delivery was not observed |
| `obligations` | committed/aborted/leaked/unresolved accounting and `balanced` derivation | one shared scenario that exercises real obligation closure at the surface boundary | one case where unresolved or leaked obligations force failure |
| `region_close` / `quiescence` | region-close facts and close boundary invariants | one shared scenario that reaches `quiescent = true` with no live children | one case where region close remains incomplete or non-quiescent |

No Phase 2 surface should be allowed to claim stronger differential closure
while any of the Phase 1 rows still lack their minimum `T0`, `T2/T3`, and `T4`
evidence.

### Core Pilot Refinement Matrix (`asupersync-2a6k9.6.6`)

`asupersync-2a6k9.6.6` exists to turn the Phase 1 floor into an
implementation-facing matrix. Pilot beads should not be allowed to say "we hit
the cancellation surface" or "we ran one channel scenario" without naming which
invariants, scenario families, and retained fields were actually covered.

The rows below refine the minimum matrix above. They do not replace it. A Phase
1 pilot bead is incomplete if its notes, tests, or retained bundles cannot be
mapped back to every applicable row here.

| Surface | Required `T0` unit-contract checks | Required shared `T2/T3` scenario families | Required `T4` adversarial witnesses | Required invariant-log focus |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `cancellation` | `cancel_request_recorded`, `checkpoint_acknowledged`, `cleanup_finalized`, `repeat_cancel_idempotent` | `cancel_before_first_poll`, `cancel_during_child_await`, `cancel_during_cleanup_budget` | `missing_cleanup_ack_hard_failure`, `cleanup_budget_exhausted`, `late_cancel_after_finalize_rejected` | `cancellation.requested`, `cancellation.acknowledged`, `cancellation.finalized`, `checkpoint_observed`, `terminal_outcome`, `repro_command` |
| `combinators` | `join_loser_drain`, `race_winner_commit_boundary`, `severity_aggregation_stable`, `nested_join_race_outcome_visibility` | `join_all_success`, `race_single_winner`, `mixed_success_failure_aggregation`, `nested_join_race_chain` | `loser_not_drained_hard_failure`, `winner_masked_by_late_failure`, `aggregate_severity_misclassified` | `loser_drain`, `terminal_outcome`, `policy_class`, `artifact_bundle`, `normalized_record_path` |
| `channels` | `reserve_abort_invisible_to_receiver`, `reserve_commit_visible_once`, `fifo_sender_order_preserved`, `sender_cancel_after_reserve_balanced` | `single_sender_commit`, `reserve_then_abort`, `multi_sender_fifo`, `receiver_retry_after_pending` | `committed_message_missing_hard_failure`, `aborted_message_delivered`, `permit_leak_forces_failure` | `resource_surface`, `obligation_balance`, `terminal_outcome`, `artifact_bundle`, `repro_command` |
| `obligations` | `balanced_after_commit_and_abort`, `unresolved_obligation_reported`, `recovery_path_preserves_lineage`, `close_boundary_obligation_snapshot` | `commit_abort_mix_at_surface_boundary`, `recovery_after_interrupted_flow`, `close_with_no_live_obligations` | `leaked_obligation_forces_failure`, `stale_recovery_overwrite_rejected`, `unresolved_on_close_hard_failure` | `obligation_balance`, `policy_class`, `normalized_record_path`, `artifact_bundle`, `repro_command` |
| `region_close` / `quiescence` | `close_boundary_rejects_new_children`, `quiescent_after_last_child`, `finalizer_completion_counted`, `nested_region_close_visibility` | `close_with_nested_children`, `close_after_child_cancel`, `close_after_finalizer_completion` | `late_spawn_after_close_rejected`, `non_quiescent_close_hard_failure`, `stuck_finalizer_retained` | `region_close`, `terminal_outcome`, `artifact_bundle`, `normalized_record_path`, `repro_command` |

Interpretation rules for the refinement matrix:

- every Phase 1 pilot surface must name at least one concrete scenario family
  for each row it claims to satisfy; "misc smoke coverage" is not enough
- every retained bundle must make the required invariant-log focus discoverable
  either directly in the scenario result record or through a stable referenced
  artifact path
- a pilot may reuse the same executable scenario across multiple rows only if
  the scenario result explicitly reports all required invariant-log focus fields
- `asupersync-2a6k9.6.6` should be treated as the checklist upgrade that future
  `2a6k9.6.*` implementation beads must point at when they claim closure

### Current Executable Anchor Inventory

The refinement matrix above is intentionally policy-shaped. This section turns
it into a concrete implementation inventory by naming the current runner
surfaces, profile lanes, calibration anchors, and the nearest stable test files
that already exercise the same semantic claims.

This inventory is the part future pilot beads should update when they add or
replace executable coverage. If a later bead lands new scenario IDs or retires
an old one, it must update this table and the companion contract test instead
of relying on tribal memory.

#### Current differential runner profiles

The current CLI-owned inventory lives in `src/bin/asupersync.rs` and now has a
machine-readable source of truth:

- `asupersync lab differential-profile-manifest --json`
- schema: `lab-live-differential-profile-manifest-v1`

That manifest is the stable operator-profile vocabulary for docs, CI, and
future playbooks. It distinguishes shipped direct CLI profiles from higher-level
operator recipes such as targeted reproduction and the reserved nightly-stress
name.

The currently shipped direct CLI lanes are:

| Runner profile | Current scenario IDs | Why the profile exists |
|---|---|---|
| `Smoke` | `phase1.cancel.protocol.drain_finalize`, `phase1.combinator.race.one_loser`, `phase1.channel.reserve_send.commit` | the fastest shared pass/fail lane for the initial semantic core |
| `Phase1Core` | `phase1.cancel.protocol.drain_finalize`, `phase1.cancel.protocol.before_first_poll`, `phase1.cancel.protocol.child_await`, `phase1.cancel.protocol.cleanup_budget`, `phase1.combinator.race.one_loser`, `phase1.channel.reserve_send.commit`, `phase1.channel.reserve_send.abort_visible`, `phase1.region.close.quiescent` | the full admitted `Phase 1` executable floor, including the pre-checkpoint, child-await, and cleanup-budget cancellation families plus the cancel-before-commit channel path |
| `Calibration` | `phase1.cancel.protocol.drain_finalize`, `calibration.combinator.loser_not_drained`, `calibration.cancellation.cleanup_missing`, `calibration.cancellation.cleanup_budget_exhausted`, `calibration.comparator.resource_counter_mismatch`, `calibration.channel.commit_visibility_mismatch`, `calibration.obligation.leak_detected`, `calibration.region.close.non_quiescent` | prove the classifier, artifact bundle, and failure-retention paths with intentional divergences, including loser-drain failure on the combinator surface and cleanup-budget exhaustion on the cancellation surface |

The wider operator-profile manifest currently publishes this vocabulary:

| Operator profile id | Status | Backing invocation | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `smoke` | shipped | `scripts/run_lab_live_differential.sh --profile smoke --seed <seed> --out-dir <out-dir>` | fastest local/shared semantic-core signal |
| `phase1-core` | shipped | `scripts/run_lab_live_differential.sh --profile phase1-core --seed <seed> --out-dir <out-dir>` | full admitted Phase 1 core validation pass |
| `calibration` | shipped | `scripts/run_lab_live_differential.sh --profile calibration --seed <seed> --out-dir <out-dir>` | intentional self-check / negative-control lane |
| `repro-targeted` | shipped | `scripts/run_lab_live_differential.sh --profile phase1-core --scenario <scenario-id> --seed <seed> --out-dir <out-dir>` | focused replay/reproduction of one selected witness |
| `nightly-stress` | shipped | `scripts/run_lab_live_differential.sh --profile nightly-stress --seed <seed> --seed-count <count> --seed-stride <stride> --rotation-date <date> --out-dir <out-dir>` | rotating-seed scheduled stress on top of the admitted `phase1-core` pack, with retained divergence artifacts and escalation-ready replay pointers |

The shipped `nightly-stress` operator recipe intentionally wraps the existing
`phase1-core` differential runner instead of inventing a second artifact
format. Each nightly execution derives a deterministic seed ring from
`rotation_date`, `seed`, `seed_count`, and `seed_stride`, then writes:

- per-seed `phase1-core` bundles under
  `target/e2e-results/lab_live_differential/nightly-stress/<date>/<seed>/phase1-core/`
- a nightly aggregate manifest at
  `target/e2e-results/lab_live_differential/nightly-stress/<date>/nightly_stress_manifest.json`
- a human-readable nightly summary at
  `target/e2e-results/lab_live_differential/nightly-stress/<date>/nightly_stress_summary.txt`
- top-level replay pointers for promoted witnesses under
  `target/e2e-results/lab_live_differential/nightly-stress/<date>/retained_divergence_artifacts/`

The seed rotation policy is deterministic: if the root seed is `S`, the stride
is `D`, the seed count is `N`, and the UTC day offset from `2026-01-01` is `R`,
then seed `i` uses `S + (R * D * N) + (i * D)`. This keeps nightly repro
commands stable while still widening the explored schedule space over time.

#### Current fast CI differential lane

The normal CI-owned differential lane is intentionally smaller than nightly or
stress usage. It currently runs two commands against the shared runner surface:

- `scripts/run_lab_live_differential.sh --profile smoke --seed 91 --out-dir artifacts/lab-differential-fast`
- `scripts/run_lab_live_differential.sh --profile calibration --scenario calibration.channel.commit_visibility_mismatch --seed 20260323 --out-dir artifacts/lab-differential-fast`

This lane exists to keep the fastest shared semantic-core witness green on
ordinary pushes while also proving that the calibration/report path still fails
loudly on a cheap intentional mismatch.

The retained CI bundle for this lane is profile-scoped and must preserve at
least these stable artifact paths under `artifacts/lab-differential-fast/`:

- `smoke/operator_summary.txt`
- `smoke/runner_summary.json`
- `smoke/artifact_index.json`
- `smoke/differential_event_log.jsonl`
- `calibration/operator_summary.txt`
- `calibration/runner_summary.json`
- `calibration/artifact_index.json`
- `calibration/differential_event_log.jsonl`

#### Surface-to-inventory map

| Surface | Current shared differential anchors | Current local unit/e2e anchors | Current calibration / negative-control anchors | Required invariant-log focus |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `cancellation` | `phase1.cancel.protocol.drain_finalize`, `phase1.cancel.protocol.before_first_poll`, `phase1.cancel.protocol.child_await`, and `phase1.cancel.protocol.cleanup_budget` in `src/bin/asupersync.rs`; shared contract lanes in `tests/lab_live_scenario_adapter_contract.rs` | `tests/lab_live_scenario_adapter_contract.rs`, `tests/cancel_obligation_invariants.rs`, `src/lab/oracle/cancellation_protocol.rs` | `calibration.cancellation.cleanup_missing` and `calibration.cancellation.cleanup_budget_exhausted` | `cancellation.requested`, `cancellation.acknowledged`, `cancellation.finalized`, `checkpoint_observed`, `terminal_outcome`, `repro_command` |
| `combinators` | `phase1.combinator.race.one_loser` in `src/bin/asupersync.rs` | `tests/e2e/combinator/cancel_correctness/async_loser_drain.rs`, `tests/phase0_verification.rs`, `src/lab/oracle/loser_drain.rs`, `src/combinator/race.rs` | `calibration.combinator.loser_not_drained` proves incomplete loser drain is escalated through the shared runner and retained artifact bundle | `loser_drain`, `terminal_outcome`, `policy_class`, `artifact_bundle`, `normalized_record_path` |
| `channels` | `phase1.channel.reserve_send.commit` and `phase1.channel.reserve_send.abort_visible` in `src/bin/asupersync.rs` | `tests/e2e_channel_patterns.rs`, `src/channel/mpsc.rs`, `src/channel/oneshot.rs`, `src/channel/broadcast.rs`, `src/channel/watch.rs` | `calibration.channel.commit_visibility_mismatch` proves committed/aborted visibility failures stay loud through the shared runner | `resource_surface`, `obligation_balance`, `terminal_outcome`, `artifact_bundle`, `repro_command` |
| `obligations` | currently piggybacks on `phase1.cancel.protocol.drain_finalize`, `phase1.channel.reserve_send.commit`, and `phase1.region.close.quiescent` because each emits `obligation_balance` in the normalized record | `tests/obligation_lifecycle_e2e.rs`, `tests/cancel_obligation_invariants.rs`, `src/lab/oracle/obligation_leak.rs`, `src/runtime/obligation_table.rs` | `calibration.obligation.leak_detected` | `obligation_balance`, `policy_class`, `normalized_record_path`, `artifact_bundle`, `repro_command` |
| `region_close` / `quiescence` | `phase1.region.close.quiescent` in `src/bin/asupersync.rs` | `tests/close_quiescence_regression.rs`, `tests/semantic_adr_regression.rs`, `tests/region_lifecycle_conformance.rs`, `src/lab/oracle/quiescence.rs`, `src/lab/oracle/finalizer.rs` | `calibration.region.close.non_quiescent` proves non-quiescent root close is escalated through the shared runner and retained artifact bundle | `region_close`, `terminal_outcome`, `artifact_bundle`, `normalized_record_path`, `repro_command` |

Interpretation rules for the executable inventory:

- `phase1.cancel.protocol.before_first_poll` is the canonical pre-checkpoint
  cancellation witness and must keep `checkpoint_observed = false`
- `phase1.cancel.protocol.child_await` is the canonical awaited-child
  cancellation witness and must retain `loser_drain` evidence
- `phase1.cancel.protocol.cleanup_budget` plus
  `calibration.cancellation.cleanup_budget_exhausted` are the canonical bounded
  cleanup pair for proving the budget-success and budget-failure stories stay
  machine-readable
- `calibration.combinator.loser_not_drained` is the dedicated adversarial
  anchor for incomplete loser drain; future beads may widen the combinator
  family, but this baseline loser-drain failure witness must remain executable
- `calibration.region.close.non_quiescent` is the dedicated adversarial anchor
  for close-with-live-children evidence; future beads may extend it with richer
  nested/finalizer witnesses, but this baseline anchor must remain executable
- a bead may cite file-level anchors from this table only if its retained bundle
  also points at the exact scenario ID or test it exercised
- when obligation evidence is piggybacked through another surface, the bundle
  must still expose `obligation_balance` as a first-class discoverable field
- if a new runner profile is added, it must be described here with the exact
  scenario IDs it admits and the reason that profile exists

## Contributor Playbook (`asupersync-2a6k9.8.3`)

This section is the operator-facing and contributor-facing handoff for the
current lab-vs-live differential stack. It is intentionally procedural: a new
contributor should be able to pick a surface, run the right lane, inspect the
right artifacts, and know when to escalate into a new bead instead of
reverse-engineering prior sessions.

The playbook is downstream of the shipped profile manifest in
`src/bin/asupersync.rs` and the current operator-profile vocabulary:

- `local_smoke`
- `targeted_core_validation`
- `self_calibration`
- `targeted_repro`
- `scheduled_stress`

The manifest remains the source of truth:

- `asupersync lab differential-profile-manifest --json`
- schema: `lab-live-differential-profile-manifest-v1`

### Preflight checklist before touching a new surface

Before writing code or wiring a new scenario:

1. confirm the surface is admitted by
   `docs/lab_live_differential_scope_matrix.md` or by an explicit eligibility
   gate such as `asupersync-2a6k9.7.3`
2. identify the normalized observables the surface must emit using
   `docs/lab_live_normalized_observable_schema.md`
3. identify the failure vocabulary the surface must reuse from
   `docs/lab_live_divergence_taxonomy.md`
4. identify the minimum tier floor from this document (`T0`, `T1`, `T2`, `T3`,
   `T4`, and when applicable `T5`)
5. reserve the intended edit surface, announce the bead in Agent Mail, and
   avoid claiming a surface that another live agent already owns
6. pick the smallest scenario family that exercises the surface without adding
   unrelated transport or host noise

If any of those answers are still vague, the surface is not ready for a new
differential scenario yet.

### Current copy-paste workflows

These are the canonical day-to-day commands for the currently shipped runner
surface. They are written in the same vocabulary as the profile manifest so the
playbook stays aligned with the CLI.

| Workflow | When to use it | Command | Expected output root |
|---|---|---|---|
| `smoke_local_validation` | confirm the shared runner still works on the admitted semantic core before or after a small change | `bash scripts/run_lab_live_differential.sh --profile smoke --seed 91 --out-dir target/e2e-results/lab_live_differential/playbook-smoke` | `target/e2e-results/lab_live_differential/playbook-smoke/` |
| `phase1_core_validation` | validate a Phase 1 surface change across the current admitted floor | `bash scripts/run_lab_live_differential.sh --profile phase1-core --seed 424242 --out-dir target/e2e-results/lab_live_differential/playbook-phase1-core` | `target/e2e-results/lab_live_differential/playbook-phase1-core/` |
| `targeted_repro` | replay one known witness or rerun one failing scenario after a code change | `bash scripts/run_lab_live_differential.sh --profile phase1-core --scenario <scenario-id> --seed <seed> --out-dir target/e2e-results/lab_live_differential/playbook-repro` | `target/e2e-results/lab_live_differential/playbook-repro/` |
| `self_calibration` | prove the classifier and artifact-retention path still fail loudly on intentional divergence | `bash scripts/run_lab_live_differential.sh --profile calibration --seed 20260323 --out-dir target/e2e-results/lab_live_differential/playbook-calibration` | `target/e2e-results/lab_live_differential/playbook-calibration/` |
| `scheduled_stress` | broader rotating-seed discovery after the fast/core/calibration lanes are already credible | `bash scripts/run_lab_live_differential.sh --profile nightly-stress --seed 424242 --seed-count 4 --seed-stride 9973 --rotation-date <date> --out-dir target/e2e-results/lab_live_differential` | `target/e2e-results/lab_live_differential/nightly-stress/<date>/` |

The playbook rule is simple:

- start with `smoke_local_validation`
- escalate to `phase1_core_validation` when the bead changes an admitted Phase
  1 semantic surface
- use `targeted_repro` whenever the run already has a known `scenario_id`
- use `self_calibration` whenever the bead changes classifier, artifact, or
  report logic
- use `scheduled_stress` only after the earlier lanes are already stable enough
  to make retained-nightly failures actionable

### Required artifact paths and report fields

Every workflow above must leave behind the same stable top-level artifacts:

- `runner_summary.json`
- `operator_summary.txt`
- `artifact_index.json`
- `differential_event_log.jsonl`

The shipped `nightly-stress` operator root adds three more required artifacts:

- `nightly_stress_manifest.json`
- `nightly_stress_summary.txt`
- `retained_divergence_artifacts/`

When a contributor inspects `runner_summary.json`, the minimum report fields to
read before drawing any conclusion are:

- `profile`
- `profile_contract.evidence_grade`
- `profile_contract.confidence_label`
- `profile_contract.runtime_cost`
- `profile_contract.operator_intent`
- `profile_contract.exit_semantics`
- `expected_divergence_count`
- `unexpected_divergence_count`
- `missing_expected_divergence_count`

When a contributor inspects `artifact_index.json`, the minimum operator question
is whether the retained files actually point at the same scenario lineage that
the summary claims to represent. If the index and summary disagree, treat the
run as an artifact-contract failure before treating it as a semantic result.

### How to add a new surface without cargo-culting existing pilots

When adding a new differentialized surface, do the following in order:

1. add or update the surface contract and normalized observable mapping
2. create at least one `T0 unit_contract` check for the local invariant
3. add `T1 golden_fixture` coverage if the bead emits any serialized record,
   summary, or artifact schema
4. bind one small shared scenario into the dual-run harness before widening to
   a larger surface family
5. run `smoke_local_validation` first, then the narrowest matching
   `phase1_core_validation` or `targeted_repro` command
6. add a `self_calibration` witness if the bead changes comparator, policy, or
   artifact logic
7. update the executable inventory table in this document so future contributors
   do not need session archaeology to find the scenario again

If the new work cannot satisfy those seven steps, it probably belongs in a gate
or policy bead first rather than in a new executable pilot.

### Escalation branches for common outcomes

| Observed result | Meaning | Required next step |
|---|---|---|
| `unexpected_divergence` | the shared runner found a mismatch that is not admitted by the scenario contract | inspect `runner_summary.json`, `artifact_index.json`, and `differential_event_log.jsonl`; rerun the exact witness through `targeted_repro`; then open or update a bead tied to the retained artifact bundle |
| `missing_expected_divergence` | a calibration witness stopped failing where it is supposed to fail | treat this as a guardrail regression first; check classifier/report code before claiming any semantic improvement |
| `artifact_schema_violation` | the run did not preserve the minimum artifact contract | fix the artifact pipeline before making any semantic statement about the result |
| `unsupported_surface` | the scenario crossed a boundary the current program does not admit | stop and route the work back through the relevant eligibility gate instead of broadening the claim informally |
| `scheduler_noise_suspected` | the run may be noisy but not yet conclusively irreproducible | rerun through `targeted_repro`, preserve seed lineage, and do not silently widen tolerances |
| `irreproducible_divergence` | reruns did not stabilize into a trustworthy policy class | retain the full bundle, hand off ownership explicitly, and consider promoting the witness into the future nightly-stress corpus |

The playbook is intentionally conservative. Contributors should bias toward
opening a new bead with a retained artifact pointer instead of explaining away a
result in prose.

### Nightly stress retention and promotion rules

`nightly-stress` inherits the same bundle redaction policy from
`docs/lab_live_divergence_taxonomy.md`, but the operator recipe makes the
retention and promotion decisions explicit:

- local retention stays at `14` days unless the contributor deliberately
  promotes the witness into a longer-lived corpus
- CI retention stays at `30` days and must preserve the nightly manifest, the
  nightly summary, and every replay-pointer file under
  `retained_divergence_artifacts/`
- any `unexpected_divergence` on an admitted surface becomes an
  `open_or_update_bead_with_retained_bundle` promotion candidate
- any repeated or minimized witness may graduate into the stable regression
  corpus after a maintainer turns the retained bundle into a dedicated scenario
- any `missing_expected_divergence` remains a guardrail regression first, not a
  semantic win

The purpose of `nightly-stress` is to make new witnesses actionable, not to
accumulate unowned artifact piles.

## Supported Claims and Limitations Matrix (`asupersync-2a6k9.8.4`)

This section is the calibrated reader-facing statement of what the current
differential program proves today, what it only partially covers, and what
remains outside the current trust boundary.

The matrix below must stay aligned with the actual profile manifest, the scope
matrix, and the currently shipped scenario packs. If the implementation grows
or shrinks, this section must change with it.

| Current claim | Evidence grade / profile vocabulary | What the claim does support | What the claim does **not** support |
|---|---|---|---|
| Fast shared semantic-core smoke signal | `t2_dual_run_smoke`, `baseline_signal`, `smoke`, `local_smoke` | the admitted semantic-core runner can execute a small shared lab/live set and retain the standard artifact bundle | full Phase 1 coverage, broader adversarial discovery, or any claim about external/host-heavy surfaces |
| Full current Phase 1 floor across admitted semantic surfaces | `t3_pilot_surface`, `surface_backed`, `phase1-core`, `targeted_core_validation` | cancellation, combinators, channels, obligation-visible outcomes, and region-close/quiescence through the current admitted scenario families | exhaustive schedule exploration, real kernel/network timing, or automatic coverage for transport-heavy / browser / raw-socket / HTTP surfaces |
| Guardrail and classifier self-checks work | `t4_negative_control`, `guardrail_validation`, `calibration`, `self_calibration` | intentional divergence, artifact retention, and policy classification still fail loudly with replayable bundles | proof that a production surface is correct merely because calibration passes |
| One retained witness can be replayed directly | `selected_scenario_tier`, `repro-targeted`, `targeted_repro` | a named scenario with a pinned seed can be rerun with the same artifact/index vocabulary | any broad statement about neighboring scenarios or the full surface family |
| Rotating-seed nightly adversarial search is shipped for the admitted Phase 1 pack | `T5 stress_nightly`, `nightly-stress`, `scheduled_stress` | the admitted `phase1-core` scenario pack now runs as a deterministic rotated-seed nightly lane with aggregate manifests, retained divergence pointers, and direct replay/minimization guidance | automatic coverage for new surfaces, host-heavy timing behavior, or any claim that a nightly pass proves correctness beyond the current admitted semantic pack |

`nightly-stress` is now shipped as an operator recipe on top of the admitted
`phase1-core` pack. It widens discovery pressure over rotated seeds, but it does
not magically broaden the program's surface-admission boundary.

### Partial and out-of-bound claims

The current differential program is intentionally narrower than "the entire
runtime" or "all live behavior." The following boundaries are explicit:

| Surface family | Current status | Why the claim is limited |
|---|---|---|
| admitted `Phase 1` semantic surfaces | supported today | these are the surfaces with concrete shared scenarios, retained artifacts, and current runner-profile vocabulary |
| additional internal surfaces not yet differentialized | partial | they may have unit or local E2E evidence, but they are not covered by the current shared profile pack until a bead binds them into the dual-run runner |
| `raw_socket`, `http_surface`, and `browser_surface` gates | not covered by the current core profiles | they require the explicit eligibility-gate machinery from `asupersync-2a6k9.7.3` and related documents before any stronger parity claim is honest |
| real network timing, kernel poller behavior, and ambient host scheduling | outside the current trust boundary | the current program compares admitted semantic observables, not every source of real-world latency or host nondeterminism |
| fabric, RaptorQ, and other broad subsystems with no current dual-run scenario pack | outside the current claim set unless a retained scenario says otherwise | local tests or docs do not automatically become lab-vs-live differential evidence just because the subsystem exists |

The honest short answer to the motivating question therefore remains:

- yes, the project can compare lab and live behavior on supported surfaces
  using retained artifacts and stable profile vocabulary
- no, the project does not yet simulate or prove every external-system behavior
  or host-driven effect

## Structured Logging Standard

Every executable differential bead must emit structured logs or records with a
minimum vocabulary that is stable across suites.

### Required Identity Fields

Every scenario-level log or record must include:

- `schema_version`
- `suite_id`
- `scenario_id`
- `surface_id`
- `surface_contract_version`
- `seed_lineage_id`
- `phase`
- `runtime_kind`
- `runner_profile`
- `adapter`

### Required Execution Fields

Every scenario result or mismatch record must include:

- `attempt_index`
- `rerun_count`
- `status`
- `divergence_class`
- `policy_class`
- `known_nondeterminism_qualifier`
- `normalized_record_path`
- `artifact_bundle`
- `repro_command`

### Required Semantic Summary Fields

When a run emits a normalized record summary, the log vocabulary must preserve
the fields that later operators and comparators need to reason about:

- `terminal_outcome`
- `cancellation`
- `loser_drain`
- `region_close`
- `obligation_balance`
- `resource_surface`

These may appear as embedded objects, stable summaries, or referenced paths,
but the scenario result record must make them discoverable.

### Required Artifact Records

The retained bundle for a differential run must be discoverable through stable
names. At minimum, executable program beads should converge on:

- `differential_summary.json`
- `differential_event_log.jsonl`
- `differential_failures.json`
- `differential_deviations.json`
- `differential_repro_manifest.json`

When normalized records are emitted as standalone artifacts, both sides should
also expose:

- `lab_normalized.json`
- `live_normalized.json`

### Forbidden Logging Habits

The following do not satisfy the standard:

- free-form human prose with no machine-readable fields,
- logs that omit `scenario_id` or `seed_lineage_id`,
- logs that record raw trace drift without saying whether semantic fields differ,
- logs that record a failure with no `repro_command`,
- logs that bury the artifact bundle path only in stderr text.

## Failure Diagnostics and Retention

This standard inherits the final policy classes from
`docs/lab_live_divergence_taxonomy.md` and adds minimum logging obligations:

| Policy class | Minimum retention required |
|---|---|
| `runtime_semantic_bug` | full bundle, normalized lab/live records, repro commands, rerun summary, artifact pointer |
| `lab_model_or_mapping_bug` | full bundle plus the inconsistent mapping or comparator evidence |
| `artifact_schema_violation` | malformed or missing artifact summary plus direct repro command |
| `insufficient_observability` | reduced bundle plus explicit missing field list and blocked-surface note |
| `unsupported_surface` | reduced bundle plus explicit scope rejection reason |
| `scheduler_noise_suspected` | reduced bundle plus rerun summary and provenance drift summary |
| `irreproducible_divergence` | full bundle plus rerun chronology and ownership handoff note |

## Validation Commands

Heavy validation commands must run through `rch exec --`.

- `rch exec -- cargo fmt --check`
- `rch exec -- cargo check --all-targets`
- `rch exec -- cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`
- `rch exec -- cargo test --test lab_live_verification_taxonomy_contract -- --nocapture`

If this bead or a later bead adds executable helper code, it should also run
the narrowest relevant contract or smoke test under `rch exec -- ...`.

## Downstream Binding

This standard is upstream policy for the immediate follow-on beads:

| Downstream bead | What it must consume from this document |
|---|---|
| `asupersync-2a6k9.2.2` | shared helper behavior and mismatch messages must satisfy `T0`, and helper usage must expand beyond one bespoke suite |
| `asupersync-2a6k9.2.5` | harness contract tests and smoke e2e coverage must satisfy the minimum bead-class matrix here |
| `asupersync-2a6k9.4.5` | live evidence and normalization tests must provide `T1` golden records and structured summary fields |
| `asupersync-2a6k9.5.4` | reusable runner scripts and report pipeline must emit the exact required identity, execution, and artifact fields |
| `asupersync-2a6k9.5.5` | negative-control and self-calibration scenarios must use the `T4 negative_control` requirements here |
| `asupersync-2a6k9.6.6` | the pilot coverage matrix and invariant log contract must refine, not replace, the minimum Phase 1 matrix here |
| `asupersync-2a6k9.7.3` | eligibility gates for raw-socket, HTTP, and browser surfaces must publish the external-surface gate matrix, required gate log fields, and rejection cases defined here |
| `asupersync-2a6k9.8.*` | CI, nightly, summaries, and contributor playbooks must preserve these tier names and required artifact fields |

If a later bead claims completion with weaker evidence than this document
requires, that bead is incomplete even if the implementation itself looks good.

## Explicit Non-Goals

This document does not:

- replace the semantic equality rules in
  `docs/lab_live_normalized_observable_schema.md`,
- replace the final policy classes in `docs/lab_live_divergence_taxonomy.md`,
- require every contract-only bead to invent fake executable differential runs,
- treat performance parity as a substitute for semantic coverage,
- allow manual inspection alone to stand in for structured logs or retained
  artifacts.

## Exit Criteria

`asupersync-2a6k9.1.4` is complete when:

1. this document exists and is substantial,
2. the taxonomy tiers are explicit and reusable,
3. minimum unit/e2e/negative-control requirements are stated for later beads,
4. structured logging vocabulary is concrete enough to validate mechanically,
5. downstream beads can reference this document directly instead of guessing
   what "tested" means,
6. the contract test for this document passes deterministically.
